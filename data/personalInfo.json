  "BIO": "I am is Jaider Vanegas. You can call me Kike. After 10 years as an English teacher at the top language centers in my city (Medellin, Col.) I have decided to leave my comfort zone to expand and look for new horizons. That's what defines me best.. that I am fearful like everyone else, but it won't keep me from testing my limits and reaching out for what I want.",
  "BIO2": "I am a multidisiciplinary person. I play the guitar, the harmonica, and other musical instruments that I have learned on my own. I paint and draw using different techniques. I learned English and managed to get to a C2 level with an honorary mention given by the University of Michigan and Cambridge English Dep. I am learning French, and I am able to understand Portuguese... all of these with no official training, but just pure will, determination, and a couple of videos on YouTube. I play different kinds of sports: I play soccer, American Football, and do freestyle rollerblading... all of them at a competitive level. Finally, I love reading. My favorite authors are Wade Davis and Joseph Marshall III",
